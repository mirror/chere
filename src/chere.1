.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chere
.RB \-<iuxlrhv>
.RB [ \-lracnmpf12 ]
.RB [ \-t
.IR term ]
.RB [ \-s
.IR shell ]
.RB [ \-d

.RB [ \-o
.IR options ]
.RB [ \-e
.IR menutext ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chere
adds the 
.I term
/
.I shell
combination to the folder context menu. This allows you to right click a folder in Windows Explorer and open
.I shell
in that folder.
.PP
Where possible, a login shell will be started. i.e. login scripts (
.B /etc/profile, ~/profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, /etc/csh.login, /etc/zprofile, $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile /etc/zlogin $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
) are run as appropriate for the shell. This does not apply to cmd, which does not have any login scripts.
.PP
The title of the window is not set. It will default to whatever the terminal sets it to. This can usually be controlled from the shell by passing an escape sequence to the shell.

Version

Supported terminals:

Supported shells:

.SH USAGE
.PP
A command (
.B -iuxlrhv
) must be specified before
.B chere
does anything. All other options modify how these commands work.
.PP
The
.B -i
(install) and
.B -u
(uninstall) commands are mutually exclusive. The
.B -l
and
.B -r
commands may be specified in addition to
.B -i
,
.B -u
or
.B -x
, in which case the read/list is done after the install/uninstall/refresh.

.PP
The context menu may be (un)installed for all users
.B \-\^a
, or just yourself
.B \-\^c.
To (un)install for all users, you will require appropriate access rights. i.e. you need to have Administrator rights.

.PP
If the -i flag is passed without specifying a shell, the shell specified in
.B /etc/passwd
for the current user is added. If
.B term
is not specified,
.B cmd
is used.

.PP
If the
.B -u
flag is passed without specifying a shell, all installed context menus will be uninstalled. If
.B -a
or
.B -c
is also specified, only the context menus for the specified users are uninstalled. Otherwise the context menus are removed for all users and the current user.

.PP
It is not possible to uninstall a context menu for a user who is not the current user.

.PP
The 
.B passwd
shell tries to determine your preferred shell at runtime from your
.B /etc/passwd
entry. This is most useful on multi-user systems.

.PP
By default, registry entries are added so that the context menus can be removed using the Add Remove Programs utility in the Windows Control Panel. The
.B -m
option prevents this. Note that this uninstall option invokes
.B chere.
When installing for the current user,
.B chere
will attempt to set an uninstall entry. If the user does not have appropriate rights to add keys to the HKLM hive, then the uninstall will not be present. Using
.B -m
will avoid the error message.

.PP
The
.B -1
and
.B -2
options select how
.B shell
is started. The original method (
.B -1
) of registry one-liners is succint, but does not work on network shares or with
.B ash
and
.B tcsh. Nor will it cope with paths containing apostrophes.
It also results in an extra
.B sh
process when the
.B passwd
shell is used. These issues should not be present when invoked via
.B xhere
(
.B -2
).
.B xhere
requires your login script to check the environment variable
.B CHERE_INVOKING
, and avoid changing to your
.B HOME
directory if it is present. The login script should unset the variable after it sees it, so that subsequent child logins are unaffected.

When using
.B -e
you can specify a keyboard shortcut for the context menu by prefixing the appropriate letter in the text with an ampersand (&).

Freshening (
.B -x
) updates all currently installed context menu items. However, it does not preserve custom user arguments and menu entry text. If you have previously specified these with
.B -o
or
.B -e,
do not use it.
Freshening does support the use of
.B -o
in the same invocation. It will abort if you attempt to specify the menu text entry with 
.B -e.

.SH DEBUGGING
Several options are present to aid debugging.

.PP
The
.B -p
option will print the
.B regtool
commands to
.B stdout
for inspection instead of executing them.

.PP
The
.B -l
command lists the currently installed shell here context menus.

.PP
The
.B -r
command lists the commands currently in the registry associated with all possible context menus.

.PP
The
.B -f
option forces
.B chere
to overwrite existing commands even if
.I shell
can\'t be found

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
\&./chere -il -t rxvt -s tcsh
.PP
Install 
.B tcsh,
for all users using
.B rxvt
as the terminal, then list what is installed.

.SH KNOWN BUGS
If you have an old or custom startup script, the shell may not enter the desired directory. The login script modifications described above are provided in the default startup scripts; the cygwin setup program attempts to merge updates in these scripts to your local login scripts, but this may not work. The default startup scripts can be found at:
.PP
.B /etc/defaults/etc/profile
(provided by base-files, used by 
.B ash,
.B bash
and
.B pdksh)
.PP
.B /usr/share/doc/zsh-x.x.x/StartupFiles/zprofile
(provided by zsh)
.PP
.B /usr/share/doc/tcsh/...
(not currently provided)

.SH HINTS
If you are using
.B cmd
as a terminal because you don't want to install
.B X
consider using
.B rxvt
instead.
.PP
If you really do like
.B cmd
you can still use it as a shell in
.B rxvt
or
.B xterm.
.PP
Use 
.B ~/.Xdefaults
to set terminal resources (colour, font etc). This even works for rxvt in non-X11 mode.
.PP
You can use
.B -o
to set the terminals -name option,
.B -e
to distinguish the context menu entries, and specify separate terminal resources for each of the context menu entries in
.B ~/.Xdefaults.
